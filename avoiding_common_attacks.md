## Avoiding Common Attacks


# Reentrancy

We are using the withdrawl pattern in the Smart Contract. The withdraw function is a used by user to withdraw their funds. By using the transfer() function instead of call.value() we limit the amount of wei transmitted to any fallback function.

# Owner Profile

The constructor initializes the owner's profile using their address so in case something goes wrong one can kill the contract and remove it from the blockchain with all the funds remaining safe.

# Integer overflows/underflows

For this I have used SafeMath contract to escape from such attacks.

# DDoS

We have used the pull over push payments method which protects it against the threats of DDoS.


# Timestamp tampering


We do not use any timestamp from the block hence it protects us from minor tampering with the blocks' timestamps.

# Bugs

In case any bugs are detected in the contract, we can freeze the contract and fix them without incorporating heavy damage while the bug is being fixed.
